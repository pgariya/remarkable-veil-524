<!-- All the folder structure information -->
=> Before you start:
   - I have already created all the folders which you will need during journey.

   - Dont use any other folder to make files if you are doing please inform the
     team members that you have created a folder with name.

   - I have already setup all the things related to `redux`, `.env`, `Chakra UI` and `react-router-dom` 
     You guys have to just start developments.

   - Also given you sample `Navbar` and `Footer` components so that you get 
     comfortable about folder components export.

   - You will get all the routing files in `routes` folder.

   - You can also use context-api if needed.

   - All the end-points and base-url should be in env files.

   - Use `assets` folder for images,pdf,video..etc
   - Use `components` folder for making components either in folder or without folder 
     just be sure naming should not match with other folder/file to avoid collision
   - Use `pages` folder to create all the pages
   - Use `routes`  folder to all the routing related stuffs
   - Use `scripts` folder for any js script you wanna write.(this folder helps you to 
     keep jsx and js folder separate)
   - Use `styles` folder to keep your all css files.
   - Use `constants` folder to create all the constants (Helps you reducing hard-coding)(Most recommended)

<!-- Git related stuffs -->
=> Some basic requirements(Mandatory):
       1- You have to work in daily branches manner, so you have to create
          new branch everyday . So you have make branch using your student_code 
          followed the day in which you working. below is the eg for my branches.

               - branch-naming style: fw21_XXXX_day-x

            -for day-2 branch name should be: fw21_1003_day-2
            -for day-3 branch name should be: fw21_1003_day-3
            -for day-4 branch name should be: fw21_1003_day-4
            -for day-5 branch name should be: fw21_1003_day-5

        2- How to create branches:
            - $git branch <branch-name> (without angle brackets)
        
        3- How to switch branches:
            -$git switch <branch-name>  (without angle brackets)
        
        4- How to pull:
            -$git pull origin <branch-name>    (without angle brackets)
